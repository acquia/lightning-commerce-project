# <img src="lightning_commerce.png" width="32"> Acquia Commerce Lightning distribution

A Composer-based installer for the [Lightning for Commerce](https://github.com/acquia/lightning-commerce) Drupal distribution.

## Getting Started
First you need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) and [Git](https://git-scm.com).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
$ composer create-project acquia/lightning-commerce-project MY_PROJECT
```

Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT containing a ```docroot``` directory with a full Lightning for Commerce code base there. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.
